# My Repo

This is based off the old Packix repo. This took me a long time to get right so can you not just rip this off and edit it to fit your repo? Thanks

Cloning this is a big effort as you have to change everything manually whereas I have a script that does it for me :)

Didn't think I'd need to do this, but I did unfortunately
